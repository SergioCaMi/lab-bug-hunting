# LAB - BUG hunting! 🐛

## Introduction
In this exercise, you will find JavaScript code that contains errors (bugs). Your goal is to identify and fix these errors so that the code works correctly. The exercises cover topics such as arrays, objects, functions, arrow functions, callbacks, and DOM manipulation.

## Instructions

1. Open the file `exercises.js` and review each of the exercises.
2. Identify the errors present in the code.
3. Fix the errors and add comments explaining what was wrong and how you fixed it.
4. You can run the code with node by just typing `node exercises.js` in the terminal.

## Tips for Finding Bugs

- **Syntax errors**: These kinds of errors will be our worst enemy 😓. You can detect syntax errors by highlighting the variable or function name and checking if VS Code highlights the occurrences.
- **Arrays and Objects**: Check how elements and properties are accessed. Make sure that indices and elements exist.
- **Functions and Arrow Functions**: Verify the syntax and how parameters and return values are used.
- **Callbacks**: Ensure that callback functions are being called correctly and receiving the appropriate arguments.
- **console.log()**: Use `console.log()` to print values that are undefined or not behaving as expected. Console is your best friend when debugging JavaScript code 😊

## Exercises

In the file `exercises.js`, you will find several sections of code. Each contains one or more errors. Your task is to:

1. Read the code carefully.
2. Identify and correct the errors.
3. Comment in the code the corrections you made.

Good luck! 🍀
